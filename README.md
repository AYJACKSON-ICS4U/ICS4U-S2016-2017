ICS4U Course for Mr. Seidel's classes

By the end of this course, you should be able to create any of the following:
* A visualization program to visualize large amounts of data
* An in-depth video game (or set of video games)
* Solve a complex problem with the assistance of a program
* Create an application as requested by a teacher or community member

The course will be set up in a way that allows a lot of freedom of choice in completing your work.  There will be many options of programming languages, and methods of submitting non-programming understanding.  For the programming portion, it is highly suggested that you choose one of the following options as they are installed at school, and are easy to work with.

#### Suggested options
* JavaScript - used in many websites, and more recently in desktop applications (see [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) as an example)
    * [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/)
    * any other JS library available can be "installed" easily, such as [Matter.js - physics engine](http://brm.io/matter-js/), [RiTa.js - computational literature](http://rednoise.org/rita/), [D3.js - for data driven documents](https://d3js.org/), and many more.
* Lua 5.3
    * [CoronaSDK](https://coronalabs.com/corona-sdk/) - mobile app development
    * [LÃ¶ve2D](https://love2d.org/) - graphics engine - used for mobile app and game development
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
    
#### More traditional options:
* Python 3
    * [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - used for game development
* Java
    * [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
