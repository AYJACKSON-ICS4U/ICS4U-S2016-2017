#### Option 1 (Audio)

1. Choose one of [these songs](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Antique_Phonograph_Music_Program_Various_Artists/Antique_Phonograph_Music_Program_03312015) to complete your work for this project.
2. Create a **small program** to visualize the audio.  You can use the amplitude, frequency, or any other specific property of the audio you chose.  
3. Document your work properly.
4. Resources below might prove useful.

#### Option 2 (Video)

1. Choose a video from [Pexels - Videos](https://videos.pexels.com/) and download it to your computer.  Choose a video that is less than 30 seconds if possible (save on space).
2. Display the video differently (i.e. add a filter of sorts - [see this example](https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video-pixels.html)).  Do not use the example as your program.
3. Create a **small program** to complete this task.

#### Important Note

This program will not be marked heavily, so do not spend a lot of time working on this - just complete the proof-of-concept as required in the rubric. Be ready to talk about your solution.
