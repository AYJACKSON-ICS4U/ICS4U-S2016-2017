Task(s)
-------
1. Copy your **5a - Sorting** program.  
2. Update the program as follows:
   * Remove the words array
   * Create a duplicate of the numbers array
   * Create a new ```superSort(arr)``` function that only has one line of code: ```return arr.sort()```. 
   * Create an input box that you can use to search for a particular number.
   * Create 2 buttons - 1 for completing a binary search, and 1 for completing a linear search
3. Copy/paste a ```binarySearch()``` and a ```linearSearch()``` algorithm from online to use (give credit in comments), or create your own.
4. Sort your duplicate numbers array using your new ```superSort(arr)``` function.
5. Using the value entered in your new input box, output the time required to find the value in the array
6. Answer the following questions in an _ANALYSIS.md_ file:
   * Compare the length of time it would take for the linear search to find something (on a worst-case basis) and how long the binary search would take on a typical basis.
   * What situations would you use ```sort()``` + ```binarySearch()``` rather than just using ```linearSearch()```? What about vice versa?
7. Resources below might prove useful.
