Task(s)
-------
Create a basic program that contains the following functions and uses them in a visual way

```javascript
addition(number, number) //returns the answer as a number
subtract(number, number) //returns the answer as a number
multiply(number, number) //returns the answer as a number
divide(number, number) //returns the answer as a number
maximum(number, number) //returns the larger of the two values as a number
minimum(number, number) //returns the smallest of the two values as a number
reverseArray(array of numbers) //returns a reversed array. Create the algorithm yourself - do not use a built in "reverse()" function 
```

Below is an example of how the _addition_ function would be written:
```javascript
//JavaScript (JSdoc)
/** This function takes in two numeric values and returns the sum of those two values
 *
 *  @param {number} first   This is the first float of the sum
 *  @param {number} second  This is the second float of the sum
 *  @return {number}        The sum of first and second as a float value
 */
function addition(first, second) {
	return first + second;
}

```
