Task(s)
-------
1. Choose a video from [Pexels - Videos](https://videos.pexels.com/) and download it to your computer.  Choose a video that is less than 30 seconds if possible (save on space).
2. Display the video differently (i.e. add a filter of sorts - [see this example](https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video-pixels.html)).  Do not use the example as your program.
3. Create a **small program** to complete this task.  This program will not be marked heavily, so do not spend a lot of time working on this - just complete the proof-of-concept as required in the rubric. Be ready to talk about your solution.
