Task(s)
-------
1. Prove you understand recursion in a P5js or Processing environment.  Do **not** use work from:
	1. Grade 11, or
	2. Last semester's class, or
	3. [Generating a fractal tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU).
2. To prove your understanding, create a program that displays an animated visual that is themed as one of the following: **_Earth_**, **_Air_**, **_Fire_**, or **_Water_**. (do not use the same theme as a previous assignment).
3. Document your work properly.
4. Resources below might prove useful.  

  * [Recursion in Processing (Nature of Code)](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/)
  * [Recursion in Processing (Fractals) (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Facu6ZVeA)
  * [Objects in p5js - Example (Circles)](https://p5js.org/examples/examples/Structure_Recursion.php)
  * [Objects in p5js - Example (Fractal Tree) (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU)
  


Submission Item(s)
------------------
1. Rename the **04a - Recursion** folder to **05a - Recursion**
2. Submit your work into the **05a** folder of your repository.
3. Modify the _README.md_ file in the **05a** folder to explain what your program does.

Due Date(s)
-------------
To be uploaded to the repository by 11:59pm on May 3rd, 2017  
**There will be a recursion test on May 4th, 2017 in class to ensure understanding**_
