###Git Related
1. Go through all of your previous assignments and remove your last name from all files.
2. Go to [Github.com](http://www.github.com/) and create an account.
3. Once you have an account, click on [this link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/e8c3946ba6decb6d704632aa2b0d4aa8) in order to add a repository to your account automatically.
4. You will be using this repository to save all of your work to.
5. Clone the repository to create a local copy on your G drive.
6. Any time you make changes to your work, you should _Push_ all of your work to the online repository on at least a weekly basis.  A good habit to get into is to post them at the end of every class.
7. See the [videos](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/Notes/01%20-%20Git%20and%20Github) (coming soon - need updates) on how to use Git with GitHub properly.

3. In Git GUI create a new repository named "grade12-cs" (or something similar) within your _G:\\git_ folder.
4. Go to GitHub, and create a new public repository with the same name, **without** a _README.md_ file.
5. In Git GUI, connect your GitHub repo with your local copy.
6. Once connected, copy your previous 3 assignments into the "grade12-cs" folder, then _add_, _commit_, and then _push_ them to the GitHub repository.
7. After adding and committing your previous assignments, create a new README.md file, and update the contents of that file in order to explain the purpose of this initial repository.
  * Following creation, _add_, _commit_, and _push_ this new README.md file to the GitHub repository.

###Quick program and practice with Git/GitHub
1. Create a basic sketch in Processing that creates circles on the screen wherever you click, and displays a count of how many clicks have occurred in the centre of the screen.
2. Once the program is complete, convert the folder into a Git folder (and GitHub repo), and using Git GUI upload the program to GitHub.
