Task(s)
-------
1. Copy your **4a - Reading Files** program.
2. Update the program to have a second array that contains all the numbers of the file.
3. With your two arrays filled, create the following two sorting algorithms (do not use the built-in ```.sort()```).
   * ```bubbleSort()``` - used to sort the numbers array
   * ```insertionSort()``` - used to sort the words array
4. After sorting your arrays, display the information of both arrays in ascending order (lexicographical order for the words array).
5. Run the program again, but this time using the ```.sort()``` built-in function.  Calculate the time it takes to complete the sorts, and place your findings in an _ANALYSIS.md_ file.
6. There is a basic example available in the _example_ folder
7. Resources below might prove useful.  
   * [Bubble Sort (C++/Java)](http://cathyatseneca.github.io/DSAnim/web/bubble.html)
   * [Insertion Sort (C++/Java)](http://cathyatseneca.github.io/DSAnim/web/insertion.html)
   * [Sorting Presentation](https://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/sorting/)

Submission Item(s)
------------------
Rename the **04b - Sorting** folder to **05b - Sorting**  
Submit your work into the **05b** folder of your repository.  
Modify the _README.md_ file in the **05b** folder to explain what your program does.  
Create an _ANALYSIS.md_ file to compare the length of time it takes for your own algorithms to run in comparison to just using the ```.sort()``` built-in to the language.
